🎮 Game Title: Terminal Frequency

🧠 Core Concept

Terminal Frequency is a narrative-driven, pixel-styled browser game where players act as underground agents infiltrating retro-style radio broadcasts filled with AI-generated propaganda. Using a vintage terminal interface and a series of interactive windows, the player must strategically persuade listeners to question the narrative before being discovered and kicked out.

🚀 Gameplay Overview

You start in a fake retro OS interface with pixelated UI.

Your main tool is a command-line terminal where you enter commands like scan-freq, connect 95.6, etc.

Connecting to a frequency opens a radio window that shows:

AI-generated host + caller dialogues (WhatsApp-like or caption style)

Mic and TTS input options (type or speak)

A live listener count and a "Questioning" meter showing how many are doubting the narrative

🎯 Player’s Objective

> Convince 80% of the radio's listeners to start questioning the propaganda before you get:



Muted

Disconnected by the AI security system

Timed out

🗝️ Core Mechanics

🎙️ Speech Interaction

Use mic or text-to-speech to interact with the host and callers

Stay calm and logical — ranting gets you flagged or muted

You get a “protected free speech window” (~2 minutes) where they won’t mute you (to preserve the illusion of fairness)


📈 Listener Persuasion System

Each message you send is evaluated for how convincing, coherent, and disruptive it is to the host’s narrative

If you say something impactful:

Listeners start doubting

The “Questioning” meter goes up


If you’re chaotic or nonsensical:

You gain suspicion points

Host/security may eject you from the frequency



👮 Security AI

Tracks your tone, content, and repeated behaviors

Too many strikes = kicked out

Random "checks" may happen where your last 2-3 messages are re-evaluated

🖥️ UI Design

Full pixel art / retro OS aesthetic

Windows are movable, draggable, and include:

🖥️ Terminal window

📻 Radio window

🗞️ News window (future feature — reference content, side stories, or notes)

📝 Notepad window for personal logs


Styled like Windows 95/NES/CRT interfaces, using pixel fonts and vintage themes






🧱 UI Breakdown

You’re building a fake OS desktop with:

Component	Description

🖥️ Desktop Canvas	Acts like a fake pixel OS UI with movable windows
💻 Terminal Window	Command interface to trigger events (like connecting to radio)
📻 Radio Window	Contains mic, TTS, host/caller UI
🗞️ News Window (optional)	Floating reference/news feed window
📝 Notes Window (optional)	Player’s notepad / mission log


All windows are pixelated UI, draggable, resizable, and maybe even minimize/maximize if you want to go full Win95-core.

🧰 Recommended Tech Stack

🎨 1. UI Framework

Use React + TailwindCSS for logic and structure. Then layer the pixel aesthetic over it.

BUT for drag-movable windows + fake desktop:

Use react-rnd for resizable/draggable window behavior.

OR use react-draggable if resizing isn’t needed.

For window focus & z-index management, look at react-window-manager.



---

🧱 2. Pixel UI / Retro Aesthetic

Use either:

🔹 Option A: Pure CSS Pixel Art + Retro Themes

NES.css – NES-style pixel UI components.

98.css – Classic Win98 styles using just CSS.

retro-css – Terminal-punk styles (aesthetic af).

Windows95 UI – Very Win95-ish UI components for React.


Mix in pixel fonts:

Press Start 2P or VT323

Use via Google Fonts or host locally



---

🔹 Option B: Canvas-based Fake OS UI (Advanced)

If you want 100% custom visuals, consider rendering everything in <canvas> using:

PixiJS (fast, supports shaders, UI-like interactions)

Phaser 3 (2D game engine with window layering support)


But honestly, unless you’re making it game-loop-heavy, go with React + CSS + drag libs for speed.

🎚️ 3. Audio + TTS + STT

Feature	Tool

Microphone Input	WebRTC or Web Audio API
Whisper API	For transcribing mic input
TTS	ElevenLabs or Bark (use text to audio stream via Web Audio)
Audio FX	Add retro static/effects using Web Audio API (or just overlay noise clips)



---

🧠 4. LLM Backend

Feature	Tool

Host & Caller AI	GPT-4 or Claude with prompt memory
Persuasion Engine	Scoring system via LLM evals or heuristics
Infra	FastAPI / Node backend (whichever you prefer)
Hosting	Vercel (frontend) + Supabase / Render / GCP (backend)



---

📦 5. Optional Enhancements

Use zustand or redux for window state management (z-index, minimized, open windows).

Add localStorage for player notes/history.

Add keyboard shortcuts (cmd + N = new note, etc) using react-hotkeys-hook.
