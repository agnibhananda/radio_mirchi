# 🎮 Radio Mirchi

Ever wanted to be a secret agent battling propaganda on retro radio? That's exactly what Radio Mirchi is all about! Jump into this pixel-styled browser game where you're an underground agent trying to wake people up by infiltrating AI-generated radio broadcasts. It's like being a digital resistance fighter with a vintage terminal as your weapon.

The inspiration for Radio Mirchi came from the realization that propaganda and misinformation spread through seemingly innocent channels that sound reasonable at first glance. We wanted to create an interactive experience that would help people understand how subtle manipulation works in media, while also being genuinely fun to play.

## 🎯 The Mission

**Your Goal**: Get 80% of the radio listeners to start questioning what they're hearing

**Game Over If**:
- The host catches on and mutes you
- The AI security system kicks you out

## 🛠️ What's Under the Hood

### Frontend (The Pretty Stuff)
- **React 18+** - Because we like our components fresh
- **TailwindCSS** - Making things look good without the headache
- **react-rnd** - For those draggable windows that feel so satisfying
- **[RetroUI](https://retroui.io/)** - Pre-made retro components (because why reinvent the wheel?)
- **[react-sound-visualizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sound-visualizer)** - Those cool waveforms you see
